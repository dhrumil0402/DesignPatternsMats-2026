# Phase 9 — Decorator questions

**Pattern / focus:** Decorator.

**Read first:** [Guide 09](../../materials/guides/09-decorator.md) · [Requirements](requirements.md)

## How to answer

- Use your own wording. Do not paste teaching-example types (for example HTTP client wrappers) as if they were your greenhouse classes.
- When a question asks about *this application*, refer to `ActuatorPort`, policy decorators, and `actuator_execution_log` from the lab.
- Short answers are fine when the question is narrow. Write a few sentences when it asks you to explain or compare.
- Write each answer inside the matching **Your Answer** note. Replace the placeholder; leave the question text unchanged.

## A. Pattern

1. State the intent of Decorator in plain language. Why is stacking wrappers a flexible alternative to a combinatorial explosion of subclasses (`LoggingRetryMaxRuntimeActuator`, …)?

2. Name the participants (**component**, **concrete component**, **decorator**, **concrete decorators**). What interface does every decorator present to the caller, and why must that match the wrapped component?

3. **Order matters.** Using logging and retry (or logging and max-run-time) as an example, explain how wrapping A around B can change what you observe compared with wrapping B around A.

## B. This phase of the application

4. What is `ActuatorPort` here, and which **at least two** decorators did you stack around the real adapter (for example logging and max run-time)? Where is the chain wired (composition root / factory), and why not inside the HTTP router?

5. Max run-time can **short-circuit**: the inner adapter is never called. Why must a blocked attempt still produce a row in `actuator_execution_log` with `success=false` and the policy named in `policy_applied`?

6. How does max run-time know the actuator has been running too long (for example `actuator_states.updated_at` from Phase 8)? Why is that data from **State**, not something the decorator should invent as a second lifecycle?

7. `GET /api/actuators/executions` feeds the dashboard execution log. Why persist attempts in the database instead of only printing to stdout? What should the UI show after a blocked attempt and a refresh?

## C. Compare, contrast, and scenarios

8. Contrast Decorator with **Adapter**. Both wrap. One **keeps** the interface and **adds** behaviour; the other **changes** the interface and **translates**. Which is which in this greenhouse (Phase 9 vs Phase 5)?

9. Contrast Decorator with **inheritance** of combined policies. How does composition let you add or remove a policy without a new subclass for every combination?

10. A classmate’s decorator changes the method signature “a little” (extra required argument, different return type). Another ignores wrap order and cannot explain whether logging runs once per logical call or per inner attempt. Explain why each is a trap.
