# Phase 6 — Strategy (Requirements)

This is the **assignment**. Implement from these requirements. If you get stuck or want to check your design, use the [guided check](guided-check.md) (signatures and partial snippets — not a complete solution).

After you implement, answer the [questions](./questions.md).

## Purpose

Add **pluggable automation strategies** that decide irrigation (or equivalent) from **latest DB readings** and **zone thresholds**, and persist which strategy applies per **location**.

## Scope and naming rules

- Evaluate **per zone inside a `location_id`**, using that zone’s thresholds from Phase 4 and the latest moisture reading among sensors with that `devices.zone_id`.
- A zone with no assigned moisture sensor does not borrow another device’s reading. Document the result (for example action `wait` and a reason such as “no moisture sensor in this zone”).
- Those readings may come from a manual read, the simulation sampler, or a translated MQTT payload. Do not assume a row exists only after `POST /read`. Do not add a scheduler, sampling UI, MQTT client, a second zone-assignment API, or the device readings route in this phase.
- Do not hard-code “if moisture < 0.3” in the API handler. Algorithms live in strategy classes behind a common interface.
- `location_id` naming only — no `greenhouse_id`.

## Outcome required at end of phase

- At least two strategies produce different recommendations for the same context.
- Active strategy key is persisted per location.
- Evaluate endpoint returns a recommendation DTO.
- Dashboard strategy panel can save a key and trigger evaluate.
- Scalar documents automation endpoints.
- Pattern note at `docs/patterns/strategy.md`.

---

## Prerequisites

- Phase 5: `sensor_readings` populated by the shared ingest path (manual read, simulation sampler, or translated MQTT payload).
- Phase 4: zones with moisture thresholds, and devices assigned with `zone_id`.
- Alembic at Phase 5 head.

---

## Required architecture for this phase

- **Domain:** strategy interface `decide(context)`; concrete strategies; context object built from readings + thresholds (plain Python).
- **Application:** DTOs for strategy key + evaluation result; service loads context from repositories, selects strategy, returns recommendation.
- **Infrastructure:** persist `strategy_key` (dedicated `automation_rules` table **or** columns on `locations` — pick one and document it); repositories for rules and for assembling context.
- **API:** save strategy; evaluate for a location.
- **Frontend:** dropdown + evaluate; show recommendation.

## Type hints

Domain:

| Type | Fields |
|------|--------|
| `LocationAutomationContext` | `location_id: UUID`, `zone_id: UUID`, latest moisture `float` from sensors in that zone (optional light `float`), zone `low`/`high` `float` |
| `Recommendation` | `action: str` (e.g. `irrigate` \| `wait`), `reason: str`, optional `score: float` |
| Strategy key | `str` — `"conservative"` \| `"aggressive"` |

ORM `automation_rules` (preferred):

| Column | SQL hint |
|--------|----------|
| `id` | UUID PK |
| `location_id` | UUID FK → `locations`, **UNIQUE** |
| `strategy_key` | VARCHAR |
| `parameters` | JSONB, optional |
| `updated_at` | timestamptz |

Evaluate response JSON: `{ location_id, strategy_key, action, reason }`. Save body: `{ "strategy_key": string }`.

---

## Step-by-step implementation requirements

## Step 1 — Persistence of strategy choice

Either:

- Table `automation_rules`: id, **`location_id`** FK unique, `strategy_key`, optional `parameters` JSON, `updated_at`; or
- Columns `strategy_key` + `parameters` on `locations`.

Autogenerate and apply. Index/unique so one active strategy per location.

Acceptance criteria:

- Changing strategy in the API updates persisted data.
- No `greenhouse_id` in schema.

## Step 2 — Strategy domain

Interface with `decide(context)` returning a recommendation (action, reason, optional intensity).

At least:

- Conservative moisture strategy.
- Aggressive moisture strategy.

Context includes latest moisture (and optionally light) plus zone low/high thresholds for that location.

Acceptance criteria:

- Same context, different strategy keys → observably different recommendations (document the difference).
- Unknown strategy key is rejected before calling `decide`.

## Step 3 — Application orchestration

Build one context per zone in the location: that zone’s low/high plus the latest reading among sensors with that `zone_id`. Do not pass raw ORM rows into strategy classes. Do not use an unassigned device’s reading.

Map recommendation to a DTO.

Acceptance criteria:

- Strategies stay free of SQLAlchemy.
- Missing location → not-found style error.

## Step 4 — API

- Upsert strategy for a location (PUT/PATCH or POST).
- `POST /api/locations/{location_id}/automation/evaluate` (or equivalent) → recommendation.

400 for unknown keys; 404 for missing location.

Acceptance criteria:

- Scalar shows schemas.
- Evaluate uses the **persisted** key, not only a query param (query override is optional extra).

## Step 5 — Frontend

**Strategy panel** in `#automation`:

- Dropdown of known keys; save to API.
- Evaluate button; display action + reason.
- Tailwind; error/success states.

Acceptance criteria:

- Change strategy → next evaluate differs for the same moisture (seed or read first).

## Step 6 — Tests and docs

- Unit tests with a fake context for both strategies.
- Optional integration with seeded readings + zones.
- `docs/patterns/strategy.md`: problem, interface, where in code, add-a-third-strategy exercise.

---

## Definition of done

- Strategy key persisted per location.
- Two algorithms behind one interface.
- Evaluate API + UI work against DB readings and zone thresholds.
- Tests and pattern doc complete.

---

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- `if strategy == "conservative"` in the router instead of polymorphism.
- Reading thresholds from hardcoded constants instead of `zones`.
- Evaluating without persisting the selected key.

---

## Handoff to next phases

- Phase 7 (Facade) will aggregate latest readings, strategy key, and last recommendation into one overview DTO. Latest rows may already be arriving from the sampler or MQTT ingest; this phase does not own that pipeline.
