# Phase 10 — Command questions

**Pattern / focus:** Command.

**Read first:** [Guide 10](../../materials/guides/10-command.md) · [Requirements](requirements.md)

## How to answer

- Use your own wording. Do not paste teaching-example types (for example editor undo commands) as if they were your greenhouse classes.
- When a question asks about *this application*, refer to command objects, the invoker, `command_log`, and the controls UI from the lab.
- Short answers are fine when the question is narrow. Write a few sentences when it asks you to explain or compare.
- Write each answer inside the matching **Your Answer** note. Replace the placeholder; leave the question text unchanged.

## A. Pattern

1. State the intent of Command in plain language. What does it mean to **objectify a request**, and what can you do with that object that you cannot do with a bare `actuator.start()` call (queue, audit, undo, history)?

2. Name the participants (**command**, **receiver**, **invoker**, **client**). Who creates the command, who triggers `execute()`, and who actually changes actuator/hardware state?

3. If a command supports undo, when must it capture the data needed to reverse the action? Why is “capture **before** mutate” critical?

## B. This phase of the application

4. Which command types did you implement (for example `start_pump`, `stop_pump`, `set_light_level`)? Why does the HTTP handler create a command and pass it to an **invoker** (or application service) instead of calling the actuator adapter from the router?

5. Walk through the execute path: (1) consult State / `allowed_commands`, (2) if illegal → **rejected**, (3) if legal → decorated `apply`, update `actuator_states`, log **success** or **failed**. Why must a rejected command **not** change actuator state and **not** reach inner `apply`?

6. Distinguish **`rejected`** vs **`failed`** vs **`success`** in `command_log`. Give one greenhouse example of each. Why is “illegal in this state” not the same as “policy or adapter error after the command was accepted”?

7. Why is `command_log` a **different** table from Phase 9 `actuator_execution_log`? What concern does each log record (operator intent vs policy/adapter attempt)?

## C. Compare, contrast, and scenarios

8. Contrast Command with **Strategy**. Strategy is an interchangeable **algorithm** (decide / quote). Command is a **side-effectful request** with history. How do they cooperate in this app (Phase 6 recommends; Phase 10 executes)?

9. Contrast Command with **State**. Who **triggers** the action, and who **decides whether it is legal**? Why must commands not bypass state guards?

10. The controls UI should disable actions that are not in `allowed_commands`. Why must the **backend** still reject illegal commands even if the UI is correct? What happens if a classmate’s command calls the raw adapter and skips State and Decorator?
